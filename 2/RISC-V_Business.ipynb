    "It's almost 2025, and the great RISC revolution that has been looming for decades is finally threatening to materialize. The Ethereum Foundation is [funding a formal verification effort for RISC-V ZKVMs](https://verified-zkevm.org/), chip industry legends like Michael Keller are starting companies like [tenstorrent](https://tenstorrent.com/en/vision/tenstorrent-risc-v-and-chiplet-technology-selected-to-build-the-future-of-ai-in-japan), RISC-V International (the governing body for the RISC-V standard) has [ratified the RISC-V specifications](https://riscv.org/announcements/2024/04/risc-v-international-achieves-milestone-with-ratification-of-40-specifications-in-two-years/), laying the ground for an open standard that industry can now build upon, and Justin Drake in his ambitious [Beam Chain proposal](https://youtu.be/lRqnFrqpq4k) outlined how the onset of RISC-V can massively accelerate Ethereum's ponderous roadmap dramatically.\n",
