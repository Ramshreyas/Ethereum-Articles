    "It's almost 2025, and the great RISC revolution that has been looming for decades is finally threatening to materialize. The Ethereum Foundation is [funding a formal verification effort for RISC-V ZKVMs](https://verified-zkevm.org/), chip industry legends like [Jim Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Keller_(engineer)) are starting RISC-V-driven technology efforts like [tenstorrent](https://tenstorrent.com/en/vision/tenstorrent-risc-v-and-chiplet-technology-selected-to-build-the-future-of-ai-in-japan), RISC-V International (the governing body for the RISC-V standard) has [ratified the RISC-V specifications](https://riscv.org/announcements/2024/04/risc-v-international-achieves-milestone-with-ratification-of-40-specifications-in-two-years/), laying the ground for an open standard that industry can now build upon, and Justin Drake in his ambitious [Beam Chain proposal](https://youtu.be/lRqnFrqpq4k) outlined how the onset of RISC-V can massively accelerate Ethereum's ponderous roadmap dramatically on many fronts.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Possible futures of the Ethereum protocol, part 4: The Verge](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/23/futures4.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "As Vitalik outlines in his blog post about [The Verge](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/23/futures4.html): \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"One of the most powerful things about a blockchain is the fact that anyone can run a node on their computer and verify that the chain is correct. Even if 95% of the nodes running the chain consensus (PoW, PoS...) all immediately agreed to change the rules, and started producing blocks according to the new rules, everyone running a fully-verifying node would refuse to accept the chain... However, for this property to hold, running a fully-verifying node needs to be actually feasible for a critical mass of people... Today, running a node is possible on a consumer laptop (including the one being used to write this post), but doing so is difficult. The Verge is about changing this, and making fully-verifying the chain so computationally affordable that every mobile wallet, browser wallet, and even smart watch is doing it by default.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of 'The Verge' is to make verifying blocks as easy as verifying a SNARK/STARK proof. Achieving this would mean the complexity of running a validator is reduced to just being able to download some data and verifying a 'ZK' proof. This reduces the barrier to entry for becoming a validator (along with proposals [to reduce the minimum staking amount]), and increases Ethereum's censorship resisitance and resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: 'ZK' has unfortunately become a catch-all term which is not always accurate - we will address this technology as 'Programmable Cryptography' in the next section, but keep using ZK for now.*\n",
    "\n",
    "But what does it take to verify such a proof, and, indeed, produce it in the fist place?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, let us first understand that we would be proving three kinds of things in each block:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [State](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/23/futures4.html#1): What are all the balances, addresses and raw data currently, and do they agree with the entire history of the chain? \n",
    "2. [Execution](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/23/futures4.html#2): Now that we know what the current state is, what is the post execution state transition, once all the transactions in the current block are executed? Has this been done correctly without any cheating?\n",
    "3. [Consensus](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/23/futures4.html#3): Has the cryptoeconomics of the proof of stake mechanism (which ultimately secures the chain) been executed correctly? Have all the validator actions, balances, withdrawals signatures etc been updated correctly?\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Stateless verification is a technology that allows nodes to verify blocks without having the entire state. Instead, each block comes with a witness, which includes (i) the values (eg. code, balances, storage) at the specific locations in the state that the block will access, and (ii) a cryptographic proof that those values are correct. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "State in Ethereum is currently stored in a (Merkle Patricia) tree structure, and is currently \"extremely unfriendly to implementing any cryptographic proof scheme\" per Vitalik. This is one of the motivations to move to a more friendly structure such as Verkle or STARKed binary trees. Changing this structure has already become a priority expressly to enable SNARK/STARK proving of state as described in the quote above.\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"...you should be able to verify an Ethereum block by (i) downloading the block, or perhaps even only small parts of the block with data availability sampling, and (ii) verifying a small proof that the block is valid... Getting to this point requires having SNARK or STARK proofs of (i) the consensus layer (ie. the proof of stake), and (ii) the execution layer (ie. the EVM)... Today, validity proofs for the EVM are inadequate in two dimensions: security and prover time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The time taken to prove a block with sufficiently 'weak' hardware is an essential component of The Verge - software run by solo home stakers, or even users with a smartwatch for that matter, needs to be sufficiently fast enough so that an \"Ethereum block can be proven in less than ~4 seconds.\".\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"If we want it to be possible to fully verify an Ethereum block with a SNARK, then the EVM execution is not the only part we need to prove. We also need to prove the consensus: the part of the system that handles deposits, withdrawals, signatures, validator balance updates, and other elements of the proof-of-stake part of Ethereum.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is a significantly simpler problem than execution proving, it will need to be done 'from scratch' as these efforts are not also being driven by the Layer 2s, who are heavily investing in developing zk technology for execution, but not for consensus as they delegate consensus duties to the Layer 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway is this: the future of Ethereum is ZK (or PM, really, as we will introduce in the next section) - and there are significant hurdles to cross, especially in terms of performance, before we can get there.\n",

    "**2.1 Programmable Cryptography**\n",
    "\n",
    "As introduced in a series of posts on [Programmable cryptography](https://0xparc.org/blog/programmable-cryptography-1) by [gubsheep](https://x.com/gubsheep):\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Cryptography is undergoing a generational transition, from special-purpose cryptography to programmable cryptography.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the majority of cryptography use-cases are special-purpose - custom protocols which are designed to do one thing, and one thing only. Public key encryption and the signature schemes that underlie WWW certification are obvious examples. The next generation of 'Programmable Cryptography' introduces the notion of cryptographic primitives that are flexible and composable - \"they allow us to perform general-purpose computation inside or on top of cryptographic protocols\" per Gubsheep.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we now have the capacity to perform any computation our little hearts may desire, and get cryptographic verification that it was performed correctly, without having to eat glass and develop specialized cryptographic proofs for a multitude of critical functions scattered across the code. This suggests that with the magic of Programmable Cryptography, for example, we can get a ZK proof of valid block execution for all EVM protocols that were interacted with in that particular block, seemingly for free - without writing any specialized code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2 The rise of Glue and Coprocessor architectures**\n",
    "\n",
    "In his blog post ['Glue and coprocessor architectures'](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/09/02/gluecp.html), Vitalik describes another rising trend:\n",
    "\n",
    ">If you analyze any resource-intensive computation being done in the modern world in even a medium amount of detail, one feature that you will find again and again is that the computation can be broken up into two parts:\n",
    ">- A relatively small amount of complex, but not very computationally intensive, \"business logic\"\n",
    ">- A large amount of intensive, but highly structured, \"expensive work\"\n",
    "\n",
    "ZK versions of regular Ethereum code are exactly like this. The 'business logic' is the smart contract and EVM primitive execution code. The 'expensive work' is all the ZK proving of said execution, with esoteric moon math involving 'elliptic curves' and other costly computation. This is where Virtual Machines come in - if you write prover logic for a VM, you can prove any arbitrary code that can run in that virtual machine. This is how you get 'ZK for free' (nothing is free, as we will learn below) - without having to rewrite the smart contracts themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a problem - it is very, very expensive to virtualize the EVM (itself a virtual machine), and then couple execution of EVM code with proving - easily ten-thousand-fold regular EVM execution, per Vitalik. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution? Create specialized low-level modules for all the expensive operations (often hashes, signatures, etc), and accept the (relatively miniscule) computational expense of running the business logic in the zkVM. This tradeoff is especially attractive for the kind of code typically found in smart contracts and regular Ethereum transactions.\n",

    "In August 2023, [Risc0 released Zeth, a ZK execution layer block prover for Ethereum and Optimism](https://github.com/risc0/zeth). Since then, multiple teams have followed suit, such as [Succinct Labs' SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1). By running a compatible execution client like [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) inside a zkVM like Zeth, we can obtain a ZK proof of valid block execution including:\n",

    "There are actually multiple types of zkEVMs, occupying different parts of the trade-off space between full Ethereum compatibility and proving speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type 1: Fully Ethereum-compatible, inheriting all of Ethereum's infrastructure and security, but with longer prover times (the time it takes to generate zk-proofs).\n",
    "- Type 2: Fully EVM-equivalent, striking a balance between compatibility and prover times.\n",
    "- Type 2.5: EVM-equivalent except for gas costs, prioritizing scalability but with some compatibility limitations for certain dApps and tools.\n",
    "- Type 3: Almost EVM-equivalent, making it easier to build and offering better scalability, but requiring some modifications to Ethereum dApps.\n",
    "- Type 4: Compiles smart contract source code directly to ZK-SNARKs, achieving the fastest prover times but with the lowest compatibility with Ethereum dApps and tools. This variety of zkEVM types allows developers to choose the solution that best suits their specific needs and priorities.\n",

    "### 3. RISC-V is probably the best target architecture for zkEVMs\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1 RISC-V is open source**\n",
    "\n",
    "RISC-V is a free and open source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It is an open standard managed by RISC-V international which has recently ratified the RVA23 Profile, which ensures software portability across any compliant hardware implementation. This is important because it provides a stable target for hardware companies to target. More importantly for Programmable Cryptography usecases, it is very flexible and customizable enabling the addition of specialized 'extentions' that can perform high speed cryptographic computation at a low level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2 RISC-V is modular and extendable**\n",
    "\n",
    "RISC-V has been expressly designed to make it easier to add these 'extentions' to the ISA, and its licensing as well as the community posture welcome such extentions. This is in stark contrast to its primary competitor ARM (itself a RISK ISA), which is expensive, closed-source and prohibitively licensed, as evidenced by the [Qualcomm-ARM Nuvia Lawsuit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2024/11/07/qualcomm-and-arm-trade-jabs-ahead-of-december-court-case/). The whole glue and coprocessor approach requires custom extentions at a low level, and of all competing architectures such as x86, AMD, ARM and more, RISC-V is by far the most open and permissive architecture to target.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3. RISC-V is growing**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to an open standard, there is a rapidly growing ecosystem of toolchain support, such as compilers, debuggers and formal verification tools, not to mention a plethora of hardware startups targeting this new standard - all of which are essential for any entity considering using RISC-V.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RISC-V is performance-oriented**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplicity of RISC, which stands for *Reduced* Instruction Set Architecture, [is by nature more efficient for the kinds of computation which will be required under Programmable Cryptography](https://risczero.com/blog/designing-high-performance-zkVMs). This is critical for achieving objectives such as real-time proving and single-slot finality. \n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude - it's likely that Ethereum infrastructure will extensively use zkVMs, especially in the execution layer. Hardware acceleration using custom extentions on RISC-V virtual machines and, indeed, chips are the likely way this will be achieved. This entire field is especially being driven by Layer 2's, who stand to gain by massively reducing blob cost by commiting ZK proofs instead of entire blocks to L1. Solutions like SP1 are already becoming viable and demonstrating significant performance gains - and numerous competitors are snapping at their heels. \n",
